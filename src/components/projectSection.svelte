              <p>
                In this project, I created a data pipeline where I was able to retrieve posts from the subreddit r/amitheasshole via the reddit api, make transformations on them, and then store them in google bigquery. 
                At which point I was able to fine-tune a HuggingFace BERT-based transformer to generate sentiment based classifications on the post data. 
                I also created a basic flask application in which you could import posts live from the subreddit, run the model against them, and then respond to the post.
              </p>
              <p><b>Please Note:</b> The demo for this project is slow, the UI is purely for demonstration purposes and is not efficient. I would appreciate if you could keep your usage of it to minimum so my limited budget doesn't suffer too much :).</p>

                  Before I launched my model, I had to gather the data and transform it into something storeable and useable to the model.
                  This took place in <b>Google BigQuery</b> where I stored my data in a SQL tables.
                  From there I was able to batch and extract the data as I needed it in order to train my BERT model.

              <h4>Technical</h4>
              <p>
                Even though I worked on many parts of this project, as did the rest of my group, my work on this project was generally focused building out the frontend application and pushing the project to AWS.
              </p>
              <h4>Non-technical</h4>
              <p>
                A major portion of the project which our group had to undertake was speaking with stakeholders, understanding their needs for the project, and making sure our design was well thought out and documented. 
                It was very important to us a group to set a good foundation for the project knowing that this project will be inherited.
                On top of machine generated documentation, we also wrote design docs which explained the intention behind the decisions that we made and how to get started with our code.
              </p>
              <p>
                Something that was also important to us was making sure that the inteded audience was actually getting something out of using our app.
                To ensure this we regularly met with our sponser to demo our work to ensure we were on the right track.
                We also rolled our app out to be used by students to gather data on how our app is used and how it performed.

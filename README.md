# Personal Website
This project is intended to show off who I am as well as my accomplishments. It gives those interested an easy way to get in contact with me. It also allows for easy alterations to the underlying data allowing for continued future updates.

## Project Stack
This is a full-stack application which runs on Sveltekit. This application is built and sent via github actions to run on AWS EC2 instances.



## Tools, Libraries, Languages
**Languages Used:**
- Typescript
- HTML
- SCSS 

**Libraries Used:**
- **Snarkdown**: A markdown html converter
- **AWS SDK**: For ses(emailing)

## Addtional Features for the future
Here, in order, I will list the features I want most for the app.
### Data Dashboard
I would like this app to be a bit more helpful to job search. Building on that sentiment, I would like to eventually create the ability to have a place where you can log your applications into and get back some statistics. It would also be helpful for 

**So in summary:**
- log in capabilities (likely through github Oauth)
- forms for jobs applied to, etc.
- a proxy server for storing sensative information for user sessions

### Customizability 
I would like to add more customizability to the frontend. Because, as of 8/28, everything is being dynamically rendered, I can add addtional design prefference options for each user to make their website unique.
